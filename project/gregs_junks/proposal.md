##Links:
- Microsoft minecraft research project for running simulations in minecraft
- https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo 
- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-malmo/

##Proposal:
- model - Minecraft map (finite state machine)
- optimizer - genetic algorithm
- decisions
	+ series of movements
- objectives 
	+ no of steps
	+ coins or points
	+ health
	+ movement costs

##todo:
- design an xml map
- get model running
- 10X10 grid
- ~10,000 solutions
- genetic programming code generation (add, replace, remove operations)
- use bdom, cdom

#report:
- number of generations
- time elapsed
- igd
