## Introductory Python

Read chapters one to four of [Think like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html)



## Read for Class

This part of the homework has _nothing_ to hand in.

Take a large cup of coffee, drink it, then reflect on [fsm.py](../src/fsm.py). We will talk to this code in class.

Note that [fsm.py](../src/fsm.py) implements a "domain-specific language" (DSL)
for finite state machines (FSM) written in Python.

Optional reading:
