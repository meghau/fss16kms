2. *Keywords*

    1. **Multi-objective optimization (MOO)**: 
    
    2. **Co-evolution**: 
    
    3. **Branch coverage**: “Branch coverage is a testing method, which aims to ensure that each one of the possible branch from each decision point is executed at least once and thereby ensuring that all reachable code is executed. That is, every branch taken each way, true and false.” In the paper, branch coverage is used to generate a set of test cases with high behavioral diversity.
    
    4. **Semantic Score**: In this paper, semantic score is a component of the fitness function of a GP individual. It is defined as the sum of the errors from the expected outcomes.
