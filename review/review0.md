## Theory

1. *Differentiate between Data Mining and Model Based Optimization.*
    
    According to my understanding in class, Data mining has discrete data points, leading to gaps in the training data, whereas in model-based optimization, the data points can be interpolated and we can resample any number of points between any two given points and try to obtain the optimum value.  
    Note: In my opinion, data mining is a very broad term and there do exist several methods in data mining that interpolate the data points like linear regression, and hence such generalization may seem incorrect.  
  
2. *How is Model-based Automated Software Engineering(MASE) different from traditional SE?*  

    Traditional SE focuses on services that fulfill requirements, while MASE focuses on searching interesting patterns in the software that solve a particular requirement, which would help in model evolution. In MASE, we also explore existing models.  
  
3. *Give an example of multi objective optimization.*

    A typical example would be of a student trying to make the most of the time available to him. Suppose the student has taken ’n’ number of courses and has to perform decently in every course, then he will have to strike a balance, managing and allocating sufficient time to work on for each course, so that he doesn’t spend too much only on one subject and does well in that particular one whereas fails in another. The objective here would be to well in subjects 1 to n.
